Task 01: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression 🏠

Goal:
Predict house prices based on square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Steps Performed:
1. Imported and loaded the dataset (houses.csv)
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Trained a Linear Regression model
4. Evaluated performance using MAE, MSE, and R² score
5. Saved the trained model and prediction plot

Results:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 2636.82
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 7200316.82
- R² Score: 0.9955
- Example prediction: For a 1400 sqft, 3 bed, 2 bath house → ₹168,407.96
